New York Times project2
This project is compose of SCSS/CSS, HTML and Javascript. The main new technologies used are the Javascript and SCSS. 
This his work has not a complet CSS.However, Javascript and HTML are ok (still one or two details in Javascript). 
The most difficult part for me was Javascript, therefor, here is a website for review if necessary:

I have started my work with Javascript and I was plannig to finished CSS after that but I hadn't enough time to make 
all the breakpounts. There for this work taught me to better manage my time on the next projects. In addition I will 
have to review Javascript more deeply.
For sass=> creat a document that contain all these other documents: reset, variables(breakpoint values), mixins(@media), 
global, head, foeter, content.
